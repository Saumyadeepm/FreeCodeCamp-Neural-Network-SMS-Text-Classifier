# ***Neural Network SMS Text Classifier***

1. **Problem Statement**
    - *The objective is to develop a neural network-based classifier for SMS text messages. The task involves loading and preprocessing SMS datasets, training a neural network model, and evaluating its performance in classifying text messages as "ham" or "spam".*
    
1. **Objective**
  - *To implement a robust neural network model capable of accurately classifying SMS text messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam". This involves preprocessing text data, training the neural network model, and assessing its performance using validation and test datasets.*

1. **Tasks**
  - *Load the SMS training and validation datasets from TSV files.*
  - *Preprocess the text data by converting categorical variables to numerical representations.*
  - *Construct and train a neural network model using appropriate layers and activation functions.*
  *Evaluate the model's performance using validation and test datasets, measuring metrics such as accuracy and loss.*

1. **Deliverables**
  - *A trained neural network model capable of accurately classifying SMS text messages.*
  - *Documentation outlining the preprocessing steps and neural network architecture.*
  - *Evaluation report detailing the model's performance metrics on validation and test datasets.*

1. **Success Criteria**
  - *The project will be considered successful if the trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying SMS messages as "ham" or "spam" on the validation and test datasets.*
